<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Morgan</h1>
<h3 align="center">Creative, detail-oriented, software engineer with a passion for building things and a creative background that helps build web apps that are visually engaging with a seamless and natural feeling user experience. I transitioned to software engineering during the pandemic after realizing the power coding had as a building tool. Iâ€™ve always been a maker/builder at heart, I love learning how things work, taking them apart, finding issues, fixing them, and putting them back together again.</h3>
